Compile: type make in the command line

Launch: type ./movie in the command line

Notes: Everything new for this assignment has been implemented however when linking with assignment 1 code I get a segmentation fault after inputting
a movie which seems to be coming from the update function in the server and storage class. The "I'm here" outputs to the screen are to help debug this error. 
If you happen to see what is causing the segmentation faul please include it in the marking write up as the 3rd assignment builds off this one so I need to get this one working to be able to complete the next one. Thanks! :)
